# Auction-Based Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (AUCB) Mechanisms

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Auction-Based Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (AUCB) mechanisms with strategic arms, as described in the paper by Gao et al. (2021). The AUCB model extends traditional multi-armed bandit algorithms to consider strategic elements such as bidding and budget constraints.
