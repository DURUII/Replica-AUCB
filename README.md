# Replica-AUCB: Auction-Based Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Mechanisms with Strategic Arms

> Developed and tested on Apple M1, macOS 13.5.2 (22G91).

## Overview

This repository houses the Python implementation of the Auction-Based Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (AUCB)
algorithms, which is based on the work presented in the following paper:

```
@inproceedings{gao2021auction,
  title={Auction-based combinatorial multi-armed bandit mechanisms with strategic arms},
  author={Gao, Guoju and Huang, He and Xiao, Mingjun and Wu, Jie and Sun, Yu-E and Zhang, Sheng},
  booktitle={IEEE INFOCOM 2021-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications},
  pages={1--10},
  year={2021},
  organization={IEEE}
}
```

Our codebase seeks to faithfully replicate the algorithms and experiments documented, thereby enabling verification of
the paper's claims.

## Experimental Results

The replicated experimental results are illustrated in the figure below:
